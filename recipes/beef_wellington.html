<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    <li> The Classic Beef Wellington is a classic for a reason. The gorgeous beef, beautifully wrapped in mushroom duxelles, pâté de foie gras and crisp, buttery puff pastry is luxurious. It is served at fancy events and restaurants around the world. Why? Because it looks spectacular, but it is actually surprisingly easy to make. (and most of the work can be done the day before!) </li>
