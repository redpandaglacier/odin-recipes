 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>These peanut butter cookies are the best ones yet. They have soft and chewy middles, lightly crisp edges, and a delicious peanut butter flavor. I love that the recipe is easy to make with 9 ingredients, all of which I keep on hand in my pantry. And because I have zero patience when it comes to cookies, I also love that you do not have chill the dough.</p>
